//! This exercise mainly aims at checking your understanding of
//! our basic stlc at this moment.
//! Treat this as an chance to get familiarize with lambda calculus (and of course, Rust itself)
//! The functions to implement may or may not be used in the future (yes, probably just for fun)
//! For reference solution, feel free to check `src/refsols/refsol_day2.rs`.
